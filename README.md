## Overview

This project implements an **end-to-end Big Data pipeline** using **MongoDB Atlas** and **Python** to process, aggregate, and visualize NYC Taxi trip data.  
The pipeline follows a **Medallion Architecture (Bronze → Silver → Gold)** and culminates in an interactive **Streamlit dashboard** backed directly by MongoDB (no flat files).

## Data Source

This project uses the official **NYC Taxi & Limousine Commission (TLC) Trip Record Data**, provided in **Parquet** format. The dataset includes detailed trip-level records such as pickup and drop-off timestamps, locations, trip distance, fare amounts, payment types, and vendor information. Monthly Parquet files are publicly available and are commonly used for large-scale analytics and big-data workflows.

**Source:** NYC Open Data (TLC)

## Architecture

This project implements a three-layer Big Data pipeline using MongoDB Atlas:
Raw data is ingested from NYC Taxi parquet files, cleaned and validated using
Pydantic models, aggregated into a gold layer, and visualized through a dashboard.

## Medallion Data Layers

### Bronze Layer — Raw Data
- Source: NYC Taxi Parquet files
- Collection: `raw_trips`
- Purpose: Store raw, unmodified data for traceability

### Silver Layer — Cleaned Data
- Collection: `clean_trips`
- Validation: Pydantic schemas
- Processing:
  - Type validation
  - Missing value handling
  - Invalid record removal

### Gold Layer — Aggregated Data
- Collection: `agg_trips`
- Aggregations:
  - Monthly trip count
  - Average fare
  - Average tip
  - Total revenue
- Grouped by:
  - `month`
  - `VendorID`

## Testing

Uses pytest with 3 tests covering DB connection, cleaning, and aggregation.

Tests are located in /tests and can be run with uv run pytest.

---

## How to Run the Pipeline

All commands are executed from the project root.

### 1. Ingest Raw Data
```

uv run python -m src.ingestion.ingest_data

```

### 2. Clean and Validate
```

uv run python -m src.cleaning.clean_data

```

### 3. Build Gold Aggregates
```

uv run python -m src.aggregation.aggregate_data

```

---

## Dashboard (Visualization Layer)

The dashboard visualizes **Gold-layer data (`agg_trips`)** directly from MongoDB Atlas.

### Visualizations
- Trips by Month
- Revenue by Vendor
- Average Fare Trends

### Run Locally
```

uv run streamlit run src/dashboard/app.py

```

### Live Dashboard

## Key Insights

- Taxi demand shows strong month-to-month variation.
- Revenue is concentrated among a small number of vendors.
- Average fares remain relatively stable despite large trip volume changes.
